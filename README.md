# trafic_light_controller
This repository contains the Verilog code for a simple traffic light controller implemented using Quartus. The project simulates a basic traffic intersection with three traffic lights for different directions.
Three Traffic Lights: The project simulates a three-way intersection with traffic lights controlling traffic flow in each direction.

Sequential Logic: Utilizes Verilog for implementing sequential logic to manage the state transitions of the traffic lights.

Simulation in Quartus: The code can be simulated using Quartus to observe the behavior and validate the functionality of the traffic light controller.
